While most justices found common ground on allowing the providers to challenge the law in a limited way, they split sharply on whether a broad set of Texas officials could be sued—an important procedural question that could affect the future of the state’s abortion restrictions. A slim conservative majority said they couldn’t be, prompting spirited exchanges among the justices about whether the court was retreating from its role as the protector of constitutional rights.

But it has moved farther from shore. Only about 30 vessels sat within sight of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach this week, waiting for berths at a gateway that has come to symbolize U.S. supply-chain bottlenecks. More than 60 others destined for the port complex remained in waters farther out to sea, some hundreds or even thousands of miles away, including ships that reduced speed during their voyage from Asia to delay their arrival. The ships are complying with a voluntary system set up last month by maritime officials because of fears the ports can’t safely accommodate the crush of waiting vessels as winter weather sweeps in with strong winds and rough seas.  Top news and in-depth analysis on the world of logistics, from supply chain to transport and technology.  “Container ships are very tall and blow around a lot in the wind,” said Kip Louttit, executive director of the Marine Exchange of Southern California, which monitors ship movements in the area. ”The numbers were not going down, so therefore we needed to find a way to spread the ships out.” Before the new system was put in place, many ships rushed across the Pacific to secure a berth at a container terminal by crossing a line 20 nautical miles from the ports, said Jessica Alvarenga, a spokeswoman for the Pacific Merchant Shipping Association, which represents ocean carriers and West Coast terminal operators. Under the new system, ships are placed on a wait list once they leave their last port of call, often in China. That gives captains an estimated date for a berth and allows them to slow their journey to the U.S., Ms. Alvarenga said.  The system has hidden from view a big part of the armada of cargo ships waiting to unload. But the backup at the biggest gateway for U.S. container imports remains as large as ever, with the lineup of vessels now stretching across the Pacific, signaling that big volumes of cargo are still heading for port terminals, warehouses and transportation networks that have been swamped by the imports. Between January and September, the neighboring ports handled the equivalent of 7.7 million loaded import containers, an increase of 21% from the comparable months of 2019, before the pandemic, according to research and consulting firm Beacon Economics. The Biden administration and maritime officials have sought to reduce the backlog with measures that included an attempt to extend the hours truckers pick up boxes. The measures have had limited impact, in part because of shortages of workers, trucking equipment and the sheer volume of boxes flowing into and out of the ports. A month ago, a then-record 86 container ships waited at anchor or in special drift areas within 40 miles of the port complex. By this week, the number of ships waiting for a berth in the area had fallen to 30, according to the Marine Exchange, while another 66 ships were moving toward the port at reduced speeds, known in the industry as slow-steaming, or were waiting outside a new safety zone. Jim McKenna, chief executive of the Pacific Maritime Association, which represents West Coast terminal operators in labor negotiations, said some ships now take 22 to 24 days to complete a voyage from Asia that used to take 10 to 14 days. Mr. McKenna said the new system is good for the environment because it keeps pollution from idling ships far from densely populated Southern California and because ships burn less fuel when they slow down.  

 Ships approaching California from Asia are asked to stay more than 150 miles from shore, while vessels arriving from the north or the south are asked to stay 50 miles from shore so they can spread farther apart from each other and avoid collisions.  Nahal Mogharabi, a spokeswoman for the South Coast Air Quality Management District, an air-pollution agency, said that although the new system reduces the number of ships close to shore, near-shore congestion remains higher than it was before the pandemic.  The California Air Resources Board, another air-pollution agency, estimates that the cargo surge has caused a 60% increase in smog-forming emissions from port activity, Ms. Mogharabi said. Mr. Louttit said the safety need for the new system was illustrated in November when winds of 40 to 50 knots caused eight ships to drag their anchors along the seabed, while one ship burned out the motor on equipment used to raise its anchor. No damage was caused during that incident, Mr. Louttit said.  Separately, the U.S. Coast Guard is investigating whether an oil spill close to the port complex in October was caused by a waiting ship’s dragged anchor hitting an underwater pipeline. Mr. Louttit said that strong winds sweep across the San Pedro Bay waters off the ports at least once a month during this time of year and that it was “unacceptable to have this many vessels this close together through the winter.” Write to Paul Berger at Paul.Berger@wsj.com Copyright ©2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

Federal outlays in November rose 30% to $473 billion, the Treasury Department reported Friday. Some federal government agencies, such as the Education Department and Health and Human Services, spent more last month compared with the same period last year in part because of pandemic-related programs, a senior Treasury official said. The Treasury Department’s spending so far in the fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, is up compared with last year in part because of its administration of the expanded child tax credit.

At the center of the story is the process of creating, shaping and perfecting a single episode of a TV show, from a table reading of the script on Monday to filming in front of a live audience on Friday—not just any show, but “I Love Lucy,” the beloved sitcom that ran in its original form on CBS from 1951 to 1957. The production sequences are fascinating, a privileged view of a peerless entertainer at work. Ms. Kidman’s Lucy, a woman of steely purpose and formidable energy, is an artist whose intuitive understanding of her material is matched by her fearless insistence on basic principles of physical comedy—clarity, logic, precision and simplicity. Those are not, unfortunately, principles that shape Mr. Sorkin’s film, which is nothing if not ambitious but a frustrating sprawl, what with multiple themes, incessant flashbacks and a faux-documentary framework that feels faux from the very first frames. Before the film’s debut—it’s playing in select theaters and will stream on Amazon Prime starting Dec. 21—curious minds, inflamed by furious publicity, wanted to know how close Ms. Kidman would come to looking and sounding like Lucy. Mimicry isn’t the point, though. Ms. Kidman, like the character she plays, is both a star and a performer of extraordinary skill. In the brief black-and-white re-creations of scenes from the show, she comes as close as anyone could ask to Lucy Ricardo’s gleeful energy and plaintiveness. In the movie that contains those scenes she’s a Lucille Ball-like force unto herself—her Lucy is always analyzing, asking why, micromanaging before the term was known and, in a weird way common to comics, mirthless when discussing jokes. “That’s a funny premise,” she says at one point, her face stern as a hanging judge’s.

He was intrigued, however, when the writer Malcolm Gladwell approached him with a  different idea: to record an audiobook exploring his creative process as one of the world’s most popular and prolific singer-songwriters. “The idea of discussing my music in an audio forum was attractive because I had never done that before,” Mr. Simon, 80, said in a recent phone interview. “It’s always in prose, which never captures what’s going on in my musical thinking. The audio gives me the opportunity to demonstrate what I’m thinking, what influenced me, the choices that I make.” The result of Mr. Simon’s collaboration with Mr. Gladwell and co-author Bruce Headlam is “Miracle and Wonder: Conversations With Paul Simon,” released last month by Pushkin Industries. It was recorded in nine lengthy sessions at Mr. Simon’s home in Connecticut and a studio in Hawaii, during which he was often holding a guitar, playing songs like “Mrs. Robinson, “The Boxer” and “Slip Slidin’ Away” in offhand but gripping solo acoustic renditions.

So was










            Peloton Interactive Inc.

      
        PTON -5.38%
      

      , according to a company spokeswoman.  Peloton said it knew the company’s stationary bike would be used in the new show and approved one of its instructors to appear in “And Just Like That…” But it didn’t know Mr. Big would drop dead after a 45-minute ride in the first episode.  Peloton insisted it wasn’t to blame for his demise. “Mr. Big lived what many would call an extravagant lifestyle—including cocktails, cigars, and big steaks—and was at serious risk,” said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a cardiologist on Peloton’s health and wellness advisory council, in a statement from the company.  Dr. Steinbaum, a self-described “Sex and the City” fan, said she was saddened by Mr. Big’s death. The debacle may sound like an example of product placement gone wrong. But Peloton said it didn’t pay for the bike to appear on the show.  The brand is a big part of the first episode of “And Just Like That…,” which made its debut on HBO Max Thursday.  Carrie, the show’s main character and Mr. Big’s wife, pretends to be jealous of his obsession with Allegra, a fictional Peloton instructor played by a real one, Jess King.  Peloton said it approved Ms. King’s appearance. Ms. King, who wears a tank top in the show with a Peloton logo stamped on it, didn’t respond to a request for comment.  Mr. Big tells Carrie he would rather spend the night with Allegra than go to a piano recital. “Oh, her again,” said Carrie, who is played by Sarah Jessica Parker.  As Carrie dresses for the recital, the Peloton bike looms at the entrance of her shoe-filled closet. Mr. Big smokes a cigar as she leaves. He starts a 45-minute Peloton class, gets off the bike, grabs his chest and falls to the floor.  “And just like that…Big died,” Carrie narrates.  The character has a history of health trouble, which Peloton pointed out in its statement. He had surgery to open a blocked artery in season six of the original show. But his death was still a shock.  “Mr. Big deserved better than death by Peloton,” wrote one Twitter user.  The character, played by actor Chris Noth, appeared throughout the original series, which aired on HBO from 1998 to 2004. He was also in two “Sex and the City” movies.  After the reboot was announced earlier this year, fans were more concerned with the fate of Samantha, after the show confirmed actress Kim Cattrall wouldn’t reprise her role. (Another spoiler: Samantha is alive but isn’t seen.)  While Peloton coordinated with HBO on the placement of one of its bikes, HBO didn’t disclose the plot in advance because of “confidentiality reasons,” Peloton said.  HBO declined to comment.

      ‘ Crock-Pot brand faced a similar dilemma in 2018, when an old slow cooker caused the death of a popular character in NBC’s “This is Us.” The brand responded to the episode, saying it was “heartbroken” by the death of Jack, Milo Ventimiglia’s character, but insisted it had never received consumer complaints about such an issue.  An executive at communications firm Edelman later told Ad Age that it worked with Crock-Pot to release a public apology from the actor whose character had died and that sales actually increased in the aftermath of the situation. That is not always the case. Though product placement can be a boon for brands, it can be hurtful when the portrayal is negative.  “The upside of product placement is it builds brand awareness and maybe increased positivity, but the downside is oftentimes much bigger,” said Alixandra Barasch, an associate professor of marketing at NYU’s Leonard N. Stern School of Business. “Something like this is one of those, perhaps, rare cases where it can actually backfire.”  While consumers are likely to know that exercise is typically not a dangerous activity in the rational sense, it could still put a cloud of negativity over the company or over exercise machines in general, she said.  “It might not be very conscious for them,” Ms. Barasch said, “but it still might affect their decisions on the margin when it comes to choosing a brand or choosing whether to buy exercise equipment in their home to begin with.”  Peloton in May agreed to recall its treadmills, and its chief executive apologized for the company’s initial refusal to comply with federal safety regulators. The Consumer Product Safety Commission told consumers with young children or pets in mid-April to stop using Peloton’s Tread+, saying it was responsible for dozens of injuries and at least one death. It is unclear how the Mr. Big incident will play out. HBO Max released two episodes so far, the second of which revolves around Mr. Big’s funeral. Peloton said there is some good news: “Riding his Peloton bike may have even helped delay his cardiac event,” Dr. Steinbaum said. —Sharon Terlep contributed to this article.

In the spot, the company plans to continue the optimistic mood of its other marketing pushes, betting that the Super Bowl audience will be seeking release after another year of slogging through the Covid-19 pandemic.

      Dana Marineau,



      chief marketing officer at Rakuten Rewards.  CMO Today delivers the most important news of the day for media and marketing professionals.  Advertisers in the first Super Bowl of the pandemic, in February 2021, had to grapple with setting the right tone for an event that took place before the arrival of Covid-19 vaccines and close on the heels of the divisive presidential election and ensuing Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Some companies advertising in 2021 took a somber approach, while others used humor, a tried-and-true Super Bowl tactic. Many didn’t acknowledge the pandemic.  Some industry executives said marketers will have more freedom to have fun in the 2022 Super Bowl, which will air on NBC on Feb. 13, following months of vaccine availability in the U.S. and more than a year since the presidential election. “It feels like there’s huge excitement,” said









      
      Jon Cook,



      global chief executive of ad agency VMLY&R, which has been working on Super Bowl spots for its clients. “There’s no creative limitations because of the pandemic or politics. People are really ready to get back to humor in this Super Bowl.” Unlike 2021’s big game, this Super Bowl coincides with NBC’s Olympics programming, another major platform that advertisers can use to amplify their Super Bowl messages. A month after the Super Bowl, the NCAA March Madness basketball tournament is scheduled to again take place in cities across the country, after being restricted to Indiana in 2021 and canceled entirely in 2020. “This gives us an on-ramp we haven’t had in almost two years,” said Nick Miaritis, an executive vice president at VaynerMedia, which has made Super Bowl ads for brands such as Scotts Miracle-Gro and Planters. “There’s actual big-scale audiences and live events, which allows brands to activate again, big and small, in ways that they just couldn’t during the pandemic.” NBCUniversal, part of










            Comcast Corp.


      , has been seeking at least $6.5 million for 30 seconds of advertising time in the game, up from the $5.5 million asking price for CBS’s telecast in 2021. 

 That is still a bargain for some, given the growing difficulty in assembling a big, live audience for traditional commercial TV, Mr. Miaritis said. “As the audience has become even more fragmented through this pandemic…it’s really hard to find one group of people with that scale,” he said. Avocados From Mexico, a nonprofit organization that represents avocado growers and packers, is returning to the Super Bowl ad roster after sitting out the 2021 game, breaking a six-year streak of participating.  While Super Bowl ads can be powerful tools to build brand awareness or favorability, Avocados From Mexico also aims to generate immediate sales with its ad, said Ivonne Kinser, the group’s vice president of marketing and innovation. “We’re combining [a] Super Bowl spot with a very robust digital campaign, and also a big sales effort,” Ms. Kinser said. Other advertisers in the coming Super Bowl include automaker










            Nissan Motor Co.


      ,










            Intuit Inc.’s


      TurboTax tax-preparation software; sports-betting operator DraftKings Inc. and cryptocurrency exchange FTX, which will make its first appearance in the game. TurboTax will be running its ninth consecutive Super Bowl spot, hoping to drum up business ahead of the April 15 tax filing deadline. “For TurboTax, we have a very limited window…to break through and stand out from our competition as well as get what we think is a very persuasive message in front of customers,” said Cathleen Ryan, vice president of marketing at Intuit’s Consumer Group. “The Super Bowl is really the biggest stage for us to get that message out.” Rakuten Rewards hopes the game serves as a coming-out party for its cash-back platform, helping it reach consumers who might know its name but aren’t sure what it does. “We don’t have what I would call a traditional awareness problem because people have heard or seen the word ‘Rakuten,’” said Ms. Marineau, the CMO, citing the company’s sponsorship deals with soccer team FC Barcelona and the Golden State Warriors basketball team. “What we have is an educational and consideration issue…it’s not an, ‘I’ve never heard of you before,’ it’s ‘I don’t get it. What do you do?’” Many Super Bowl advertisers see the 2022 event as having more of a festive atmosphere, VaynerMedia’s Mr. Miaritis said. “There was a real ‘hold your breath’ moment last year,” he said. “This is almost like the exhale moment.” —Alexandra Bruell contributed to this article.

Global advertising spending will grow 22.5% to $763.2 billion this year, excluding U.S. political ad spending, according to the latest forecast from GroupM, which houses the media-buying agencies and data operations of ad giant










            WPP


      PLC. Those figures are up from a GroupM prediction in June of 19.2% growth this year and total ad spending of $749 billion. In December, the company had predicted a 12% increase for this year. The report comes as digital advertising is accelerating especially quickly. Digital advertising will account for 64.4% of total advertising in 2021, GroupM said, up from 60.5% of the total in 2020 and 52.1% in 2019. Somewhere between 80% and 90% of digital advertising outside of China will go to Google parent










            Alphabet Inc.,


      Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. and










            Amazon.com Inc.,


      GroupM estimated. “The growth rate of advertising in general, and digital specifically, is far faster than we anticipated in June,” said









      
      Brian Wieser,



      global president of business intelligence at GroupM.  CMO Today delivers the most important news of the day for media and marketing professionals.  The rise is occurring as small businesses and digital companies such as app developers spend more on digital advertising. China-based marketers have also increasingly been using global digital platforms to reach overseas consumers. A growing share of digital advertising is flowing through display or search advertising that appears on retailers’ e-commerce platforms, according to another new forecast, this one from Zenith, part of the advertising holding company










            Publicis Groupe.


       Many consumer-facing businesses, including retailer










            Walmart Inc.,


      healthcare company










            CVS Health Corp.


      and food-ordering and -delivery platform










            DoorDash Inc.,


      are offering advertisers more ways to reach consumers using data they store on shoppers’ purchases. Zenith estimates that media advertising with retailers will grow 47% in 2021 to reach $77 billion globally. That comes after the segment grew 24% in 2019 and 53% in 2020.  A large piece of that figure is coming from Amazon, said Jonathan Barnard, forecasting head at Zenith. Amazon doesn’t break out advertising revenue in its earnings reports. The company said its “other” segment, which is primarily made up of advertising, brought in more than $8 billion in revenue in the quarter ended Sept. 30. “Certainly there are retailers who are picking up on this trend and starting to sell much more advertising over the last 18 months or so. But the main bulk of this money is Amazon, plus the various Chinese e-commerce networks,” Mr. Barnard said. Zenith also predicts that global social-media advertising will overtake television ad spend next year. The firm expects social-media ad spend will reach $177 billion in 2022, eking past TV advertising at an estimated $174 billion. The pandemic’s lift to e-commerce also accelerated marketers’ shift into social-media advertising. “We would have gotten there, but we got there sooner,” Mr. Barnard said.

            Cvent Holding Corp.


      on Thursday began trading on Nasdaq following a digital makeover aimed at retooling the 22-year-old event-management software company for the age of video conferences and virtual meetings.  The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team.  The move comes five years after the former public company was acquired by Vista Equity Partners for $1.65 billion and taken private. In July, Cvent agreed to merge with










            Dragoneer Growth Opportunities Corp. II,


      a special-purpose acquisition company, returning to the public market with a valuation of roughly $5.3 billion. Early investors include Fidelity Management and Research Co., Hedosophia, Oaktree Capital Management and virtual-conferencing giant










            Zoom Video Communications,


      the company said. Based in Tysons Corner, Va., Cvent has roughly 21,000 customers worldwide and about 4,000 employees, the company said. Until recently, it focused primarily on providing cloud-based software designed to help organizers manage live events, including venue selection, registration and onsite check in, among other tools. But like many companies, the onset of Covid-19 forced Cvent to pivot online and re-tailor its technology to better serve a fast-growing virtual market. “Our product strategy changed,” said









      
      David Quattrone,



      Cvent’s co-founder and chief technology officer. Before the pandemic, he said, more than 95% of the company’s revenue was focused on in-person events. “When the pandemic hit in 2020, the entire world shifted to virtual,” he said. In response, the company embarked on a full reconstruction of its platform, adding updated tools and functionality geared toward remote events. Cvent was an early adopter of a software as a service, subscription-based model in which software is delivered to users online or in the cloud. For organizations and vendors focused only on in-person events, the pandemic was a shocking wake-up call, said Adam Preset, a research vice president at IT research and consulting firm










            Gartner Inc.


       But even for tech firms that already offered a mix of face-to-face and virtual events, the swift transition was jarring, he said. “Demand for virtual events was high, which meant that sometimes some providers were turning business away because their pipelines were full in the panic and rush to virtual,” Mr. Preset said. Sales in the global virtual-events market, which hit $94 billion in 2020, are expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 23.7% over the next seven years, according to market analyst Grand View Research. 

 Cvent last month reported $134.1 million in total revenue for the quarter ended September 30, an increase of 13.1% from the same period a year earlier. Revenue from Event Cloud, its main software platform, was up 27.2% to $92.5 million, the company said. “From a tech perspective, the pandemic accelerated trends we were already seeing—and planning for—with our pipeline of investments and redesigns,” Mr. Quattrone said. “It really was a complete pivot from the in-person focus we had been used to for more than two decades.” He expects the market to continue to evolve over the next few years. If 2020 and 2021 were all about virtual, 2022 will be all about hybrid or a blend of both in-person and virtual experiences, he said. “The fact of the matter is, no matter how the industry decides to meet in the future, we’ll be there.” Write to Angus Loten at angus.loten@wsj.com Copyright ©2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

"34","https://www.wsj.com/articles/female-founders-in-short-supply-at-enterprise-tech-startups-11638993477?mod=hp_minor_pos5","Female Founders in Short Supply at Enterprise Tech Startups  - WSJ","Dec. 8, 2021 2:57 pm ET","https://www.wsj.com/articles/female-founders-in-short-supply-at-enterprise-tech-startups-11638993477 Less than 2% of enterprise software startups in the U.S. have at least one female founder according to a new report. Experts say one reason for the small number of female founders is that they have a harder time getting initial funding. The 2% figure represents just 354 enterprise software startups tracked by New York-based venture-capital firm Work-Bench, which produced the report. In 2021, 154 of those startups received funding. Work-Bench calculated the percentage using its database of female-founded companies and information from financial data company PitchBook Data Inc., which shows a total of approximately 18,500 venture capital-backed business-to-business software startups in the U.S. Women have been historically underrepresented in the technology side of the software industry. U.S. Department of Labor data from 2019 shows that 18.1% of all software developers in the U.S. are women, and those women on average earn 88.7% of what their male counterparts earn. Things aren’t easier for women who branch off to start their own enterprise software businesses, experts say. A combination of implicit biases, discrepancies in networking connections and a cycle that leaves women largely outside the venture-capital sphere makes it harder for female-led companies to get off the ground—perpetuating a stubborn gender gap in one of the country’s most male-dominated industries. “Of course it’s hurt me,” Idit Levine, the founder and chief executive of Solo.io, said about being a woman in the enterprise software space. Ms. Levine founded Solo.io, which provides application programming interface, or API, infrastructure software to help manage application traffic, in 2017. In October 2021, the company announced it raised $135 million in Series C funding at a $1 billion valuation. Still, Ms. Levine said that during the six months she spent looking for initial funding, she felt that male founders could create bonds with male investors that “obviously I could not as a woman.” “VCs want to work with people that they have great chemistry with, and sometimes that’s a euphemism for investing in people who are like you,” said April Koh, co-founder and CEO of Spring Health, a startup that uses assessment and machine-learning technology to help companies provide better mental health support for their employees.  According to a 2021 report from PitchBook, 15.4% of venture-capital general partners in the U.S. are women. Dana Kanze, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the London Business School, said part of the reason for that is that venture capitalists are often former entrepreneurs, so the fewer successful female founders there are, the fewer female venture capitalists there are. “It has to do with these misperceptions that female founding CEOs are a ‘lack of fit’ with their ventures when they happen to cater to male-dominated, as opposed to female-dominated industries,” Dr. Kanze said.  The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team.  Dr. Kanze’s research also shows that investors tend to ask male founders “promotion” questions that focus on things like the potential achievement of the company, while they tend to ask female founders “prevention” questions focusing on the things that could go wrong. According to Dr. Kanze, who studies investor behavior, investors typically pride themselves on idiosyncratic decisions based on a “gut instinct.” The result, she said, is that female founders get less money, less equity, lower valuations, and they’re less likely to even get off the ground. Christine Spang, the co-founder and chief technology officer of developer API platform Nylas, said that as a woman, she feels she has missed out on “an instant sense of rapport” with both venture investors and other startup founders who could form an advice network. Jessica Lin, the co-founder and general partner of Work-Bench, said the firm reaches out to female founders who it might not have met organically to discuss investment opportunities. Work-Bench’s portfolio is now made up of 20% female-founded companies, Ms. Lin said. That includes Spring Health, but not Solo.io or Nylas. Ms. Koh said that after the initial funding hurdle, “the playing field gets more level the later you go and the more success you’re able to show.” Eight years after founding Nylas, Ms. Spang said she has gotten used to situations where she is the only woman in the room. “In general diversity is good for innovation,” Ms. Spang said. Because of that, she said, when things are better for women, they are really better for everyone. Other findings from Work-Bench’s report reveal that San Francisco has the highest concentration of female-founded enterprise tech startups with 48.3%, followed by New York with 26.8%. The leading sector for these startups is human resources and the future of work with 35.1%, followed by data, artificial intelligence and machine learning with 19.8%.

But this time around, they say, one area they aren’t worried about is videoconferencing. Once seen as a lifeline for homebound employees—and a priority software deployment—videoconferencing apps are now a much smaller piece of efforts by chief information officers to leverage more complex technology, such as automation and artificial intelligence, to compete in marketplaces reshaped by Covid-19, CIOs and other enterprise tech leaders say. “The foundation of our remote-working infrastructure and videoconferencing capabilities are firmly in place and have been for a while now,” said David Vidoni, vice president of IT at Cambridge, Mass.-based software company










            Pegasystems Inc.


      “Now it’s just a matter of smartly integrating those tools with all our other digital transformation initiatives going forward across the business,” Mr. Vidoni said. That may spell trouble for










            Zoom Video Communications Inc.,


      whose flagship videoconferencing tool emerged as the go-to app for companies rushing to keep workers connected, sending its sales skyrocketing. The San Jose, Calif.-based startup says its online traffic hit a peak of some 300 million daily participants in April 2020, up from 10 million in December 2019. “Zoom was in the right place at the right time,” said Wayne Kurtzman, research director for social and collaboration software at research firm International Data Corp. “They were easy to use, deploy and purchase, even for the enterprise.” Since then, analysts say, much larger tech providers have added new features and functionality to their videoconferencing platforms, including










            Microsoft Corp.


      and










            Alphabet Inc.’s


      Google, which are often included in entire suites of core business apps.  The Morning Download delivers daily insights and news on business technology from the CIO Journal team.  That is putting added pressure on Zoom to innovate quickly and stay apace with market challengers, said Laura Petrone, principal analyst at research firm GlobalData PLC. “The pandemic has made this competition even tighter,” Ms. Petrone said. For Zoom, prying commercial customers away from stalwart enterprise IT vendors won’t be easy, she said. 









      
      Matt Carey,



      CIO at










            Home Depot Inc.,


      said the company uses both Microsoft Teams and










            Cisco Systems Inc.’s


      WebEx videoconferencing tools for internal and external meetings. He has no plans to swap out these apps any time soon: “We continue to rely on these platforms in our day to day,” Mr. Carey said. For now, most of the company’s technology teams, among other business groups, continue to work remotely, he said. Zoom in the past year has released hundreds of new features and upgrades for its videoconferencing app, said Gary Sorrentino, the company’s deputy CIO. They include a digital whiteboard that can be used before, during and after an online meeting, and real-time automated translations, among other tools. It has also expanded into new areas, he said, such as a service aimed at helping businesses manage physical office space, including an app with an interactive map for reserving desks or conference rooms. Mr. Sorrentino said the challenge today for CIOs is to deploy technology that supports entirely new work models that didn’t exist before the pandemic, or even immediately after the initial remote-work phase, such as hybrid strategies: “Single apps can no longer keep up with the flexibility and agility to adapt as employees evolve,” he said. Doing all of that requires a set of more flexible, engaging and comprehensive software tools, “instead of siloed offerings,” Mr. Sorrentino said. IDC estimates that the global market for collaboration apps will exceed $50 billion by 2025, nearly double 2020 levels. But the pace of growth will begin to slow down in the years ahead, IDC’s Mr. Kurtzman said. Zoom last month reported $1.05 billion in sales for the three months ended Oct. 31, a 35% increase from a year earlier, but less than the 54% increase in the previous quarter. A year earlier, sales jumped more than 360%—a sign that many companies were caught flat-footed by the pandemic and saw Zoom as a quick-and-easy fix.  Christopher Trueman, principal analyst covering employee experience, content and communication technology at tech research firm










            Gartner Inc.,


      said most companies now have multiple virtual meeting apps in place for different purposes. “A company may use Microsoft Teams for all of their internal collaboration and meeting needs, Zoom for more formal, externally facing meetings, and a specialized service such as On24 for large webcasts,” Mr. Trueman said. But, he added, big software firms have the advantage of offering their meeting and collaboration tools as part of far-reaching business-app packages, enabling them to “keep a foot in the door” with companies that rushed to install single use applications.

      Andrew Bonfield



      led the finances of a chocolate maker, a utility company and a biopharmaceutical firm before joining










            Caterpillar Inc.


       In those roles, he grew volumes and margins, funded energy projects and provided capital for research and development. During the past three years, he has been applying some of these learnings at the Deerfield, Ill.-based manufacturer of excavators, graders and other heavy machinery. As Caterpillar’s finance chief, Mr. Bonfield is working to boost profits while maintaining a conservative balance sheet and attracting new investors to the stock. He talked to CFO Journal about ESG bonds, technological changes and moving dirt. Here are edited excerpts. WSJ: You previously served as CFO of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., Cadbury PLC and










            National Grid


      PLC. What made you join Caterpillar? Mr. Bonfield: This is now my sixth public company CFO role. For me, one of the interesting things is [that] finance is fungible across different [sectors]. In many ways, accounting is accounting, regardless [of] what sector or segment you are in. Caterpillar is obviously an iconic brand. And, the second part was, I had never worked in a cyclical industrial company. WSJ: What were the core differences between these CFO roles? Mr. Bonfield: In pharmaceuticals, it’s all about research. In consumer goods, it’s a lot more about marketing. In utilities, it’s efficient funding of energy to the consumer.  [At Caterpillar], [what’s] different is it’s much more heavy manufacturing. Getting your head around the impact of having about 60% of your profit and loss related to the cost of goods sold is very different from where I’ve been in previous industries. I learned this during the consumer days: You go through a period of expanding margins, and then a period of volume growth. The problem is to do both at the same time. That’s what we’re trying to do [at] Caterpillar. WSJ: How far are you dealing with a different type of investors? Mr. Bonfield: Investors think through cyclical businesses very differently from how they think through a consumer-products business. Ultimately, you’re trying to drive volume growth and you’re trying to drive margin improvement. Those are the holy grail for every company. One of the things we’ve been doing a lot more is targeting shareholders. Trying to get people to think differently about Caterpillar through things like cash generation is really important for us.  The Morning Ledger provides daily news and insights on corporate finance from the CFO Journal team.  WSJ: How about environmental, social and governance goals, do you get more questions about those? Mr. Bonfield: ESG has become an important part of every company’s outlook. Everyone is aware that decarbonization is occurring and needs to occur. Many people [view the energy transition as a risk for Caterpillar], because “you guys produce diesel engines, and therefore, that must be a risk for you.” “You have a business in oil and gas, that must be risky.” We actually think the energy transition is a great opportunity for Caterpillar. WSJ: Why is that? Mr. Bonfield: If you think about the commodities that need to be produced to drive electric batteries, that’s an opportunity for us within our mining business. [Also], we are an integrator of technologies. We move dirt and moving dirt requires a lot of other things. It’s hydraulic cylinders. It’s engine technology. There’s a whole lot of other things that go into building an excavator or a wheeled loader or a track-type tractor. We’re working on hydrogen technology, battery technology, [similar to] a lot of our competitors. WSJ: What are the challenges around these technologies? Mr. Bonfield: The energy transition means different things to different customers. It’s not one size fits all. For example, if you’re thinking about a construction project, if you’ve got bulldozers and excavators and [other] things on site, how are you going to decarbonize those [if] you don’t have a grid connection? 

 WSJ: How likely are your customers to make changes to their operations? Mr. Bonfield: It depends, product by product and the scale of the project. Big public entities are moving the fastest. [For] mining companies, large mining trucks are one of the biggest sources of carbon emissions. So for them, that’s a priority. For a small, family-owned construction company that’s not publicly quoted in the U.S. and working on a road project that [doesn’t have] a requirement for the owner to move to a battery electric operation, probably they’re going to be the last people to move. It depends how quickly regulations change. WSJ: Few people buy a new excavator every year. What does that mean for your customers’ efforts to reduce carbon emissions? Mr. Bonfield: Obviously, a lot of our machines last for many years and customers will obviously don’t want to change until they have to. So it depends on the life cycle of their machine. And then it depends on what they see [as] the application. A mini excavator or a skid steer that is operated by a landscaping company in an urban area is probably more likely to move quicker [toward] battery electric than a large bulldozer, which is working on a road project very far away from a battery or electrical connection. WSJ: How about ESG-related financing, do you see Caterpillar selling green bonds any time soon? Mr. Bonfield: Because we’re in a strong balance sheet position, we probably don’t have much [need] for actually issuing new debt. So it’s probably not going to be a high priority.

      Billie Eilish,



      Post Malone and other artists, plans to offer additional services for free to attract more musicians to its platform, the company’s chief financial officer said.  The Morning Ledger provides daily news and insights on corporate finance from the CFO Journal team.  Berlin-based SoundCloud plans give music creators the ability to upload and distribute some of their music for free, according to Chief Financial Officer









      
      Drew Wilson.



      The company is still working on its plans, but the changes to its pricing are expected to take effect during the first half of next year, Mr. Wilson said. SoundCloud currently allows creators to upload up to three hours of music for free, and then starts charging them a subscription fee of $12 per month. The company currently charges artists to distribute music. “It’s to get you to move away from being shy about being a creator,” Mr. Wilson said, commenting on the company’s plans. SoundCloud expects that many users who join the platform for free will eventually decide to pay for its services. SoundCloud differs from other major streaming platforms such as Spotify Technology S.A. and Apple Inc.’s music service because SoundCloud allows independent artists to upload their own tracks, view data on listener engagement and connect directly with their audience. The company said it has around 30 million active creators and 300 million tracks on its platform. Privately-held SoundCloud is currently “at the doorsteps of break-even” and expects to generate a net profit by 2023, according to Mr. Wilson who is also chief operating officer. The company, which was founded in 2007, ran into financial difficulties in 2017, forcing it to cut about 40% of its staff, or 173 jobs. Investment firms Temasek Holdings and the Raine Group LLC bought a large stake in the company the same year. SoundCloud in 2019 generated revenue of €147.6 million, equivalent to $167.5 million, up 37% from a year earlier, according to a U.K. regulatory filing. Its adjusted operating loss in 2019 was €20.6 million, compared with €25.1 million a year earlier. SoundCloud’s 2020 filings will be available at the end of the year, according to the company. SoundCloud has taken steps in recent years to offer more tools and services to creators. The company in 2019 acquired Repost Network Inc., a Los Angeles-based company that helps artists and music labels distribute their music on other platforms. Both SoundCloud and its customers take a cut of the revenue that’s generated by the distribution, Mr. Wilson said. The company is currently expanding its business model to provide some of its creators with higher-end marketing services by invitation, Mr. Wilson said. “We’re trying to find the next Billie Eilish in our own yard as well as the universe,” he said. The shift is expected to generate new lines of revenue in areas such as rights and licensing deals, according to Mr. Wilson. SoundCloud is expanding the ways it partners with creators, but it doesn’t intend to have “record label-like deals with artists,” according to the company. SoundCloud may consider future acquisitions to accelerate its growth by adding new creators to its platform, Mr. Wilson said. Deals that could improve the company’s technology would also be attractive, he said. The company doesn’t plan to acquire independent labels. “In the future, we are hopeful to craft partnerships with independents in interesting and unique ways,” SoundCloud said. 

 What sets SoundCloud apart from other streaming services is the relationship that it has with independent creators, according to









      
      Mark Mulligan,



      an analyst at MIDiA Research, a media research and advisory firm. That gives the company access to millions of artists who are making music but not putting it on larger streaming platforms, he said. “I think if you look at where SoundCloud is now, it’s early on its journey in terms of the things it could do,” Mr. Mulligan said.

            Wynn Resorts Ltd.


      appointed a gambling-industry veteran to oversee the casino operator’s finances just weeks after the company announced it would elevate its finance chief to the role of chief executive. Las Vegas-based Wynn on Tuesday said









      
      Julie Cameron-Doe



      would join in the second quarter of next year. Ms. Cameron-Doe has served as chief financial officer of Aristocrat Leisure Ltd., a Sydney, Australia-based gambling-machine maker, since 2018.   The Morning Ledger provides daily news and insights on corporate finance from the CFO Journal team.  Ms. Cameron-Doe is set to succeed

      who will follow









      
      Matt Maddox



      as chief executive, effective Feb. 1. Mr. Billings, also an Aristocrat alumnus, has served as Wynn’s CFO since 2017. Mr. Maddox last month told analysts that he was leaving because he had achieved his goals as CEO over the past four years, including stabilizing the business after company founder









      
      Steve Wynn



      resigned in 2018 amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Wynn said Ms. Cameron-Doe will join the company once she completes her notice period with Aristocrat, where she has held senior finance roles since 2013. Prior to Aristocrat, she worked at the










            Walt Disney Co.


      , travel website Orbitz LLC and professional-services firm KPMG. “Julie is a proven leader and is a sitting public company CFO,” Mr. Billings said, according to a press release. “Coming from the gaming industry, she understands many aspects of our business and she has diverse international experience.” The company declined to comment beyond its release. Wynn last month reported its revenue grew to $994.6 million for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to $370.5 million the prior-year period, when casinos struggled with reduced travel to Las Vegas due to the coronavirus pandemic. The company booked a net loss of $166 million for the quarter, narrower than its loss of $758 million the prior-year period, in part due to higher operating expenses for the casino and entertainment businesses. 

 Aristocrat said it is seeking a successor for Ms. Cameron-Doe and expects to provide an update in due course. Ms. Cameron-Doe could take on some responsibility for the digital-gambling business based on her experience at a mobile-gaming technology company, said Dan Wasiolek, a senior equity analyst at financial-services firm

The ruling is a setback for the SFO, which last year secured the conviction of









      
      Ziad Akle



      on charges he conspired to bribe Iraqi officials for oil contracts, despite questions surrounding the agency’s interactions with a private investigator and former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent.  In its judgment quashing the conviction, the Court of Appeal in London sharply criticized the SFO for its dealings with









      
      David Tinsley,



      the founder and chairman of private investigation firm 5 Stones Intelligence. The court said Mr. Akle’s case had been “significantly handicapped” by the SFO’s failure to disclose documents detailing its interactions with the private investigator.  Our Morning Risk Report features insights and news on governance, risk and compliance.  “That failure was particularly regrettable given that some of the documents had a clear potential to embarrass the SFO in their prosecution of this case,” the appeals court said. The court on Friday denied a request by the SFO for a retrial of Mr. Akle. A lawyer for Mr. Akle didn’t respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for the SFO said it was currently reviewing the court’s judgment. Last year, the SFO initiated a review of its dealings with Mr. Tinsley, who between September 2018 to July 2019 had engaged in a series of interactions with senior SFO officials, including meeting personally with its director,









      
      Lisa Osofsky,



      in connection with the agency’s Unaoil case, according to emails, transcripts and other records cited by the appeals court.  At the time, Mr. Tinsley was engaged to work on behalf of









      
      Ata Ahsani



      and his sons Cyrus and Saman, who collectively owned and controlled the Monaco-based oil-services firm at the heart of the case. In his meetings and communications with the SFO, Mr. Tinsley indicated he could help the agency secure guilty pleas from Mr. Akle, a former Iraq territory manager for Unaoil, and Basil al Jarah, another individual charged in the case. According to the appeals court, Mr. Tinsley was a “fixer” seeking to broker a deal between the Ahsanis, the SFO and the U.S., both of which were seeking to prosecute the Ahsanis. Leading up to his trial, Mr. Akle had argued that the SFO’s dealings with Mr. Tinsley violated his right to a fair trial and said Mr. Tinsley had urged him and Mr. al Jarah to plead guilty. Mr. Akle also sought to use documents detailing Mr. Tinsley’s interactions with the SFO to block it from introducing evidence of the conviction of Mr. al Jarah, who in 2019 pleaded guilty to the agency’s charges. Judge









      
      Martin Beddoe,



      who oversaw Mr. Akle’s trial, rejected those arguments. While the judge conceded he might not have the full picture, he said there was no evidence the SFO had given Mr. Tinsley any sensitive information, or that Mr. Akle had undermined his own case because of his contact with Mr. Tinsley. The Court of Appeal later ordered the SFO to turn over evidence related to Mr. Tinsley’s interactions with the agency. On Friday, the court concluded the documents “illustrate very clearly why it was wholly inappropriate for the SFO to have any dealings with Tinsley” in relation to the cases against Messrs. Akle and al Jarah. “For all his talk of wanting to achieve an outcome which would be beneficial to everyone, Tinsley was obviously focused on pursuing a course which was in the best interests of the Ahsanis, including by delivering a package of pleas from others which would encourage the SFO to abandon any thought of prosecuting any of the Ahsanis in this country,” the court said. Mr. Tinsley didn’t immediately respond to a message seeking comment. He has previously stated, however, that there was nothing inappropriate in his dealings with the SFO and Messrs. Akle and al Jarah. 

 The SFO later did abandon its prosecution of the Ahsanis, according to the appeals court, following Italy’s decision to extradite









      
      Saman Ahsani



      to the U.S. instead of the U.K. Saman Ahsani, who served as Unaoil’s chief operations officer, and









      
      Cyrus Ahsani,



      who served as its chief executive, eventually reached plea agreements with U.S. prosecutors in March 2019 charging them with conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, an antibribery law. The two brothers are still awaiting sentencing in the U.S. Ata Ahsani paid a $2.25 million penalty and faced no further action, according to the appeals court. It is unclear what implications the appeals court’s judgment could have for Mr. al Jarah. In addition to Messrs. Akle and al Jarah, the SFO charged









      
      Stephen Whiteley,



      a former vice president at Dutch oil company










            SBM Offshore


      NV who also worked as a Unaoil territory manager for Iraq, and









      
      Paul Bond,



      a former senior sales manager for Unaoil client SBM Offshore. Both men were tried alongside Mr. Akle. Mr. Whiteley was found guilty of one count of conspiracy to give corrupt payments, and sentenced to three years in prison.  A jury was initially unable to reach a verdict with respect to Mr. Bond, but he was later retried, found guilty and sentenced to three and half years in prison. On Friday, the Court of Appeal declined an appeal by Mr. Bond, who had argued that his sentence was excessive. Write to Dylan Tokar at dylan.tokar@wsj.com Copyright ©2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

	Italy’s antitrust regulator fined Amazon.com Inc. $1.3 billion, saying it harmed competitors by favoring third-party sellers that use the company’s logistics services, a decision that reflects increased scrutiny of tech giants by antitrust regulators globally.

	The fine of 1.13 billion euros is part of a wave of antitrust enforcement in Europe and elsewhere against Amazon and other big tech companies for allegedly abusing their dominance to squash smaller competitors. 
	Companies including Apple Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Meta Platforms Inc.’s Facebook have in the past two years faced formal investigations, charges or fines in a variety of cases filed by the European Union and countries including the U.S., the U.K., France and Germany. The companies have denied wrongdoing. 
	Using data analytics to detect and prevent bribery and corruption isn’t just for large companies with ample resources, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission official said on Thursday. 
	“Data analytics is available to any company of any size; you don't have to have massive computational power spitting this out,” said Charles Cain, chief of the SEC’s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act unit during a virtual event hosted by the American Bar Association. “You need to be using the information you already have to run your business, to think about the compliance implications.” 
	In recent years, companies such as Microsoft Corp. and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA have pioneered the use of machine learning and other advanced data analytics in their anti-corruption programs, and government officials have encouraged other businesses to examine how they use data to ensure compliance with the FCPA. 
	Two ways companies could use data to strengthen compliance would be looking at discount percentages across jurisdictions, or monitoring employee travel and entertainment expenses, said Douglas N. Greenburg, the global chair of the white-collar defense and investigations practice at law firm Latham & Watkins LLP. “The fact of the matter is, every company has data that's relevant to compliance,” he said.

	Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler took aim Thursday at blank-check companies known as special-purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, saying they provide ordinary investors with incomplete information and insufficient protection against conflicts of interest and fraud. 
	Mr. Gensler said he wants to level the playing field between traditional initial public offerings and SPACs, which have exploded in popularity in recent years and now account for more than three-fifths of all U.S. IPOs. The deals typically feature unique incentives that allow backers to multiply their initial investments even if share prices fall and other investors lose money. 
	“I believe the investing public may not be getting like protections between traditional IPOs and SPACs,” Mr. Gensler said in a speech for the Healthy Markets Association. He said he has asked SEC staff for proposals to close that gap by focusing on requirements around disclosure, marketing practices and liability for sponsors and other gatekeepers to SPAC deals. 
	Some investors view the steps and public statements as signals that regulators are rushing to catch up with an unprecedented SPAC boom that is making startup investing available to the masses. 
	General Electric Co., Union Pacific Corp. and other large employers have suspended Covid-19 vaccine requirements for workers after a U.S. court ruling blocked the Biden administration’s plan to mandate vaccines for federal contractors. 
	A federal judge on Tuesday issued a nationwide preliminary injunction after concluding that federal procurement law didn’t give the administration the clear authority to impose the vaccine rules for contractors. Lawyers for the federal government filed a notice of appeal Thursday.

	President Biden laid the groundwork Thursday for talks with Moscow to de-escalate the crisis over the massing of Russian forces near the Ukrainian border. 
	The negotiations, which Mr. Biden said a day earlier could include some North Atlantic Treaty Organization members and Russia, promise to be difficult for the Biden administration. Russian President Vladimir Putin is demanding not only U.S. concessions on Ukraine but also revisions in the post-Cold War order in Europe. 
	The White House hasn’t announced a location, timing or format for the talks. But Mr. Biden sought to assure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the leaders of eastern-flank countries in phone calls Thursday that the U.S. wouldn’t negotiate over their heads and underscored his administration’s “commitment to trans-Atlantic security,” the White House said.

	Volkswagen AG’s besieged chief executive has survived a monthslong battle with labor leaders, but he will now lead Europe’s biggest auto maker on a shorter leash, raising questions about how fast and how far he can push through the electric transformation he started at the company. 
	VW’s supervisory board Thursday approved a compromise to end the conflict between Herbert Diess and powerful labor leaders at the company who had sought his ouster. 
	As part of the deal, Mr. Diess was stripped of some responsibilities and his management team reshuffled, with managers handpicked by the company’s directors, who include labor representatives. 
	Analysts said the deal leaves Mr. Diess weakened just as VW faces pressure from a global shortage of semiconductors, the continuing impact of the pandemic, rising challenges from Tesla Inc., which begins production of cars in Germany next year, and the rise of Stellantis NV, the Italian-French-American auto group that is challenging VW’s dominance in Europe. 
	Baristas at three Starbucks stores in the Buffalo area, including this one, cast votes on whether to establish a union at their respective locations. PHOTO: LIBBY MARCH FOR THE WALL STREET JOURNAL 
	Starbucks Corp. baristas in Buffalo, N.Y. voted to form the first labor union at one of the coffee giant’s own U.S. cafes in its 50-year history, as workers across the country push companies for better pay and benefits in a tight labor market. 
	The result is a victory for cafe workers who had petitioned in August to vote on forming a union to have a direct channel of negotiation with the company, and a blow to Starbucks, which had spent months appealing to Buffalo-area baristas to vote down a labor body. 
	In the three separate store elections overseen by the National Labor Relations Board on Thursday, the federal body said that one store voted for unionizing, one voted against it and results in the third weren’t conclusive. The labor board said it will review challenges from both sides in that store election. 
	The unionization win is a high-profile victory for labor-organizing efforts, and comes after workers at other major U.S. companies demand more from their employers as companies have struggled with labor shortages and record numbers of workers quitting this year.

Congress in January passed legislation that requires the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to create a centralized database containing information about the owners of limited liability companies and other corporate entities. FinCEN on Tuesday issued its first set of draft regulations for the new database, which lawmakers hope will help prevent the illicit use of shell companies by criminals, terrorists and other bad actors. Here are some of the key takeaways from the 180-page notice of proposed rulemaking. The proposed regulations address who must file beneficial ownership information, when they must do it and what information they must provide.  Our Morning Risk Report features insights and news on governance, risk and compliance.  But the regulations don’t address who may access the ownership registry, and how they will gain access. FinCEN on Tuesday said the rules were just the first of three sets of rules it plans to release on the legislation that calls for the creation of the database, known as the Corporate Transparency Act. The agency said it would consider database access in a separate rulemaking. The rules also don’t cover the obligations that will be imposed upon banks and other financial institutions as a result of the database, although they do offer some clues about what those would potentially look like. Banks are required to collect certain information on their customers under an existing customer due diligence rule. The legislation requires FinCEN to update its customer due diligence rule no later than one year after the new reporting requirements become effective. FinCEN appears to have taken an expansive approach to defining which companies are required to file information, and about who qualifies as a beneficial owner. A beneficial owner is defined by the proposed regulations as any individual who exercises substantial control over a reporting company, or who owns or controls at least a 25% stake in the company. The bureau outlined three indicators of substantial control: service as a senior officer of a reporting company; authority over the appointment or removal of any senior officer or the majority of board members; and significant influence over important company matters. The definition goes beyond prior beneficial-owner reporting rules, requiring companies to submit information about any number of owners, rather than determining which single individual best fits the definition. The reporting requirements generally apply to domestic corporations, limited liability companies and other entities created by the filing of a document with a secretary of state or similar tribal office, and to similar types of foreign companies registered to do business in the U.S. Financial transparency groups had argued that any exemptions to the reporting requirements should be kept narrow to increase the overall effectiveness of the law, and FinCEN appears to have done so. The regulations stick closely to the definitions provided by lawmakers for 23 exemptions to the requirement, including for securities issuers, banks and insurance companies. The exemptions mostly cover entities already subject to regulations that could require the disclosure of beneficial ownership information, according to FinCEN. Certain trusts also could be exempt from the requirements laid out in the Corporate Transparency Act, FinCEN said, since they aren’t required to file a document with a secretary of state. Reporting companies only will need to file four pieces of information about each beneficial owner: name, birth date, address and a unique identifying number, such as a taxpayer identification number. The proposed rule would require reporting companies created before the effective date of the final regulation to file an initial report within a year. Companies created after the effective date will have 14 days to file. Reporting companies will have 30 days to update previously filed reports. The rule outlines penalties for companies that willfully provide inaccurate information or fail to provide information required by the Corporate Transparency Act. FinCEN on Tuesday said it sought to minimize the burden on reporting companies, including small businesses. The Treasury bureau said it anticipates the cost to companies would be less than $50 to prepare and submit an initial beneficial ownership report. By comparison, the state formation fee for creating a limited liability company can cost between $40 and $500, FinCEN said. The comment period on FinCEN’s proposed regulations runs for 60 days, until Feb. 7, 2022. The bureau said it was also working on developing the infrastructure—namely an information technology system—to manage the data it will eventually collect.

Sparkledots Wholesale Children’s Clothing tripled its holiday-season orders because of uncertainty over whether the goods would arrive on time, Chief Executive Ginny Pasqualone said. The Ridgefield, Conn.-based business, whose legal name is VBP Enterprises LLC, imports items from China to supply retail clients in the Southwestern U.S. and has spent five times more on freight this year than in 2020. “We’d much rather have too much inventory than not enough,” said Ms. Pasqualone. “But then that eats up your margins as well.” The stakes for retailers during the critical fourth quarter, when sales and profits traditionally peak, are high this year because of supply-chain volatility, transport bottlenecks and the uncertain impact of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 on shopper behavior. “If you go over budget, people will be mad at you, but you’ll still have a job come Monday,” said Ted Stank, supply chain professor at the University of Tennessee’s Haslam College of Business. “And so the tendency is to make sure that we don’t stock out.” U.S. consumer demand has been strong this year, and has been picking up steam heading into the holidays. Sales at online and physical stores rose 14% during the Thanksgiving weekend compared with last year, according to data released by Mastercard SpendingPulse. Broad measures show retailer stocks remained severely depleted heading into the fourth quarter. U.S. retailers held $602.7 billion in inventories in September, according to U.S. Commerce Department figures, compared with the $664.4 billion they held in September 2019, before the pandemic upended supply chains. But record backups of container ships in the U.S. and logjams at other distribution chokepoints suggest big volumes of goods are still tied up in supply chains. That leaves many businesses in limbo as Christmas approaches and facing a possible flood of out-of-season merchandise in the New Year. Deep-pocketed companies such as










            Walmart Inc.,


      Target Inc. and










            Home Depot Inc.


      say their inventories are in good shape after loading up early on products and even chartering ships to ensure items arrive in time for the holiday peak. Merchants with smaller shipping budgets or less clout with suppliers have been hedging their bets, with some ordering double or even triple their usual volumes in case some orders don’t show up on time, or at all. The risks of overbuying are higher for retailers that sell a narrow range of products or goods that age quickly, such as fast fashion or Christmas sweaters, than they would be for general merchandisers whose array of merchandise provides a natural hedge. Even bigger operators like apparel retailer










            Gap Inc.


      are feeling the heat after coronavirus-related factory closures in Vietnam slowed orders in the third quarter, raising the potential for late-arriving orders. “If we think that things are going to be too late for the holiday season, we won’t put them in stores or online and have them generate markdowns,” Gap Chief Financial Officer









      
      Katrina O’Connell



      said in a Nov. 23 earnings call. In surveys by Morgan Stanley, more than 50% of companies including retailers said in each of the first three quarters this year that they planned to increase inventories. In the quarterly surveys in years before the pandemic, about 20% of shippers on average planned to increase inventories. Retailers and suppliers typically plan their inventories months in advance, making it tough to respond to gyrations in consumer demand or the prolonged supply-chain volatility due to Covid-19. “If you’re a midsize retailer, you have to decide what demand will be in Christmas in about May,” said Chris Caplice, executive director of Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Transportation & Logistics. “Forecasting for demand is just kind of out the window during the pandemic.”   Top news and in-depth analysis on the world of logistics, from supply chain to transport and technology.  This year, boutique owner Jodi Springer doubled the holiday inventory orders for Sassy Southern Designs, her women’s clothing and home décor store in Lawrenceburg, Tenn., because of high demand and shipping bottlenecks. Now she is worried some Christmas-themed items will arrive late, forcing her to hold on to the merchandise until next year. “That’s just not feasible, I need that cash flow now,” Ms. Spring said. “So I’m just hoping and praying over here that things arrive.” Merchants that end up with more product than planned often rent out extra warehouse space until they can liquidate the inventory. Such short-term arrangements tend to be more expensive than standard leases, and the value of the inventory can drop quickly, said Erik Trum, retail practice lead at Atlanta-based consulting firm Insight Sourcing Group LLC. Mr. Trum said retailers should already be planning for January’s leftovers. Merchants looking to maintain more control over their brand can cut some losses by unloading extra inventory through pop-up or flash sales targeting certain customers, he said, or selling through their own outlet stores. Many items will likely end up at discount chains like










            T.J. Maxx


      or Marshalls, both owned by TJX Cos. Liquidation typically yields pennies on the dollar. Persistent shipping bottlenecks may leave some retailers working to redirect entire late-arriving containers to discounters before the merchandise gets deeper into the company’s own supply chain, Mr. Trum said. Not all retailers expect to discount heavily on outdated inventories. Retailer Lands’ End Inc. said its supply-chain expenses are rising as it steps up efforts to get goods in stock. But seasonal items such as outerwear and boots may sell for closer to full price in January than they would normally, Lands’ End Chief Executive

	The line to unload cargo at Southern California’s port complex is moving further offshore. Maritime officials are spacing vessels waiting for berths at the logjammed ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach further apart, sending some boxships hundreds or even thousands of miles out in the Pacific to guard against hazards from crowding too close in rough winter weather. Moving part of the queue out of sight hasn’t trimmed the overall backlog, the WSJ Logistics Report’s Paul Berger writes. This week some 30 vessels were waiting within 40 miles of the port complex, with another 66 anchored further off or approaching at reduced speeds. The new system reduces crowding, which can be dangerous during high winds. It’s 
also aimed at reducing pollution. Ships burn less fuel when they slow down, and moving vessels offshore limits exposure to coastal neighborhoods that have complained about emissions from ships and trucks.

	Production delays at Boeing are reaching deeper into the business of the manufacturer’s customers and suppliers. American Airlines is slashing its summer flight schedule, the WSJ’s Andrew Tangel reports, as the latest hitch in output of 787 Dreamliner jets gums up the carrier’s plans for a pandemic rebound. Deliveries of Boeing’s wide-body jets now won’t resume until April at earliest. That’s led American to scale back planned flights to Shanghai and Beijing and cut service to Hong Kong. American’s decision is the latest scheduling move in passenger operations that will echo across the cargo sector, signaling continued limitations in the belly capacity that has contracted during the pandemic. 
Boeing’s production issues are rippling through aviation supply chains. Italian aerospace manufacturer Leonardo plans to furlough some workers who make Dreamliner fuselage sections while jet-engine maker Rolls-Royce says the delivery freeze is clouding its cash flow.

	Amazon is getting more unwanted attention in Europe as the online giant’s business practices draw criticism at home and abroad. Italy’s antitrust regulator fined Amazon $1.3 billion for allegedly favoring third-party sellers that use its warehousing and delivery services, the WSJ’s Eric Sylvers and Sam Schechner report, and the European Union’s top competition enforcer is pursuing a similar investigation. Third-party sales are increasingly important to Amazon’s business. The company’s treatment of those vendors has drawn scrutiny for practices that include using sellers' own data to develop competing products. Some U.S. vendors complain that Amazon charges too much for fulfillment. Italian regulators found Amazon used its market dominance to favor adoption of its logistics services, with “fulfillment by Amazon” sellers more likely to appear as the default when consumers click to buy a product. Amazon says most sellers don’t use those services and called the fine “unjustified and disproportionate.”

      Frank Appel



      will step down as chief executive of DHL parent Deutsche Post AG in 2023, the express and logistics giant said Wednesday, and will be succeeded by longtime company executive









      
      Tobias Meyer.



       Mr. Appel, who will leave the top position in May 2023, has led the company for more than 13 years, a tenure that includes a recent period of significant growth as the Covid-19 pandemic drove strong demand for package delivery. DHL’s supply-chain and global-forwarding businesses together rank as the top global third-party logistics provider by 2020 gross revenue, according to research group Armstrong & Associates Inc. The company, doing business as Deutsche Post DHL, had 2020 revenue of 66.81 billion euros, equivalent to about $75.7 billion, up 5.5% from 2019 and nearly 30% from 2010. This year, the company forecasts record earnings of more than $8.7 billion. Currently the chief executive of the company’s German post and parcel division, Mr. Meyer joined the business in 2013 and has held leadership roles including chief operations officer at DHL’s global-forwarding unit, which coordinates the shipment of goods from one destination to another using a range of transport options. He became a member of the company’s management board in 2019. Mr. Meyer “is the ideal choice to continue the very successful path the company has charted,”

Mr. Appel, a former executive at consulting firm McKinsey & Co., joined Deutsche Post in 2000 and took over leadership of the company in 2008 at a time of turbulence. The financial crisis was unfolding around the world, and Klaus Zumwinkel, the corporate chief who expanded Deutsche Post from a state-owned postal operator into a global conglomerate, had resigned amid a tax-evasion investigation. Mr. Appel “made the company into a leading global logistics powerhouse that connects people and markets,” Mr. von Bomhard said. “Under Appel’s leadership, the company has posted one record after the next.

While subscribing to an app, newspaper, gym or other service may now be as simple as pressing a button on a smartphone, many companies still push customers to dial a number and speak to an agent to cancel. But the common “click to subscribe, call to cancel” practice may be waning. Several companies say they plan to introduce easier ways for customers to cancel without the rigmarole of calling, as federal and state authorities home in on regulating deceptive and unfair user-experience designs. The shift even touches pay TV, a category notorious for tenacious efforts to prevent customers from leaving. A spokesman for satellite service










            DirecTV


      LLC, which allows customers to sign up online, said it plans to introduce a click-to-cancel mechanism for streaming customers next year.  DirecTV streaming customers who sign up on a month-to-month service agreement online currently must call or speak to a representative on a web chat to cancel, the spokesman said, adding that satellite customers must still call to cancel. Companies tweaking their cancelation processes say they are doing so to make things easier for customers. Such changes also come as regulators and lawmakers are beginning to crack down on companies that employ user-experience design that tricks or traps consumers into subscriptions—including practices that make subscriptions cumbersome to cancel. The Federal Trade Commission last month said it plans to ramp up enforcement against the use of illegal “dark patterns,” including deceptive sign-up tactics, and told businesses to “provide cancelation mechanisms that are at least as easy to use as the method the consumer used to buy the product or service in the first place.” The FTC said it reviews cancelation policies on a case-by-case basis, examining the barriers to simple cancelation rather than the method itself.  Get weekly insights into the ways companies optimize data, technology and design to drive success with their customers and employees.   Meanwhile California Gov. Gavin Newsom in October signed a package of amendments to the state’s law on automatic subscription renewals, including a requirement that companies let customers cancel subscriptions online without “engaging any further steps that obstruct or delay the consumer’s ability to terminate immediately.” The law takes effect July 1, 2022, bolstering California’s existing rule that customers who accept an automatic renewal or continuous service offer online must be able to cancel the service online. Companies have long used design techniques to manipulate subscribers’ spending behavior, but some enter “dark patterns” territory when they use design to hide information to encourage a consumer to sign up or keep subscribing, said









      
      Harry Brignull,



      a user-experience designer who studies deceptive user interfaces. That includes failing to remind customers when an annual subscription is renewing; advertising a cheaper, first-month deal in a large font; and onerous “call-to-cancel” policies, which can make it harder to get out of a membership than it is to join, said Dr. Brignull, who has a PhD in cognitive science. Requiring a phone call is an effective business tactic because it adds two layers of friction between the customer and the door, Dr. Brignull said: having to call in the first place, often at a stipulated and sometimes inconvenient time, and then navigating a retention specialist’s pitches. Getting a customer to talk on the phone sometimes lets companies understand and offer exactly what it might take to make them stay, such as a discount or a few months’ free service, he added. Companies planning or contemplating moves toward easier cancelations include










            Planet Fitness Inc.,


      which lets customers join online as well as in-person but does not let the majority of members quit online or even by phone. The gym chain asks members to visit or write a letter to their local gym to cancel, although it has made online cancelation options available to customers in markets like California with regulations about online cancelations.  “We are currently evaluating our membership management policies and are exploring ways to evolve them to provide additional options and convenience,” said

      senior vice president of communications and corporate responsibility at Planet Fitness. 









      
      Karl Wells,



      chief subscriptions officer for Wall Street Journal parent Dow Jones & Co., said the newspaper is testing “new ways to provide subscribers with a more flexible approach to managing their subscription preferences,” and expects to expand those in the coming months. Dow Jones already lets its Barron’s, MarketWatch and WSJ Student subscribers cancel online but requires Wall Street Journal subscribers to cancel via phone call. Customers in markets with digital-cancelation laws can cancel online, a spokeswoman said. 

 Bloomberg Media, which previously told customers to cancel by filling in an online form, in April introduced a live chatbot that lets users cancel a subscription by exchanging a few messages, a spokesman for the company said. Not all companies are leaving telephone requirements in the past, however. The Washington Post said that while digital subscribers can cancel online, customers must still call to cancel print subscriptions, even though they can subscribe to them online. “We are focused on creating an excellent experience for digital subscribers, the area where we are seeing vast subscriber growth,” said

The U.K. government is backing a trial of “safe standing” areas, in which new railings separate rows to prevent fans from falling forward. The government in 1990 mandated that top-level games be played in all-seated stadiums, a reaction to the 1989 Hillsborough disaster in which 97 soccer fans died as a result of a crush in standing-only pens at a stadium in Sheffield. Nearly every club in the top two leagues of English and Welsh soccer converted their stadiums’ standing areas, which often comprised nothing more than a set of concrete bleachers, into seated areas by the mid-1990s, and began telling fans to stay in those seats. But adding seats and rules did not compel all fans to stop standing or eliminate the possibility that they could topple onto spectators below them, causing injury or even a phenomenon called progressive crowd collapse, whereby the forward fall of one person from the back leads to a crushing domino effect. “The analogy we always use is, when you go to church and sing your hymns, you stand up,” said Peter Daykin, a board member of the Football Supporters’ Association and coordinator of its Safe Standing campaign. “There’s kind of a visceral enjoyment in that for some people.” Now, just over 20 years since the so-called all-seater legislation was passed, the teams and authorities that regulate soccer in England and Wales have designed stadium sections that account for fans’ natural game day behavior, rather than trying to control it. Five clubs—Cardiff City, Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur—will begin formally testing the approach in January. Some teams in the trial have already installed safety railings in areas of their stadiums known for persistent standing. There is no Hillsborough-style tragedy prompting the British test; so far, only minor incidents have occurred as a result of people falling from open seated areas, said Ken Scott, head of inspectorate at the Sports Grounds Safety Authority, or SGSA, the U.K. government’s official adviser on safety at sports grounds.  Get weekly insights into the ways companies optimize data, technology and design to drive success with their customers and employees.   Approaches to stadium standing vary outside the U.K. German stadiums such as Borussia Dortmund’s Signal Iduna Park have operated standing zones for decades. In the U.S., a handful of Major League Soccer teams have recently built areas designed to encourage standing, seeking the energetic atmosphere generated by fans on their feet. The teams have installed railings for safety and some have either removed seats or locked them upright in these sections. In addition to heading off potential accidents, the U.K.’s test also represents British soccer’s broader strategy to prioritize the fan experience more than it did in the past, Mr. Scott said. “Going to football matches in the U.K. 20, 30 years ago wasn’t necessarily a pleasurable experience at many of these places because customer service didn’t really feature highly on the agenda,” Mr. Scott said. “Now we’re following very much the example of the American spectator experience, looking at things like the Super Bowl and seeing how it’s very much fan-driven.” Unlike the standing sections of a previous era, the standing spaces being tested include fold-down seats, like those in movie theaters, to accommodate fans who want or need to sit during parts of a game. Computer modeling using virtual crash test dummies of differing sizes led the SGSA to recommend a rail height between 800 and 900 millimeters, equivalent to between 31.5 and 35.4 inches. “It stops you from going over the top if you did suffer a force from behind, but equally it means that if you wish to sit and watch the match, the rail is still at a height that doesn’t obstruct your vision,” Mr. Scott said. The SGSA said its priority will be to monitor the safety of fans during the trial period and work with the clubs involved to identify and resolve any issues. In addition to safety, Manchester United said it would assess fan feedback and the contribution to the stadium atmosphere, while Cardiff City said it would measure elements including compliance with the rules and the customer experience of those standing. The test will finish at the end of the British soccer season in late May, when the SGSA will submit a report on its results to the government. “I fully expect that following that report, they’ll get to roll this out to a wider base of clubs,” Mr. Scott said. “Safe standing is one of the first times I can remember that we’ve ever got something significant across the line that hasn’t required a tragedy to get us to that point.” Write to Katie Deighton at katie.deighton@wsj.com Copyright ©2021 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

            Match Group Inc.


      has introduced matchmakers to its namesake dating app, offering a small human filter to the romantic suggestions its algorithm generates, the company said. A 50-member team—who have been trained as dating coaches by the company—will select two profiles for participating members each week, drawing from the same algorithmically-generated pool the service already provides.  They will be guided by members’ answers to four questions on, for instance, what a person would change about their dating life, what sort of person a user gravitates toward, and others. The service costs $4.99 a week. The company created the feature because, for some singles, the pandemic has added a degree of urgency to finding a long-term relationship, said









      
      Amarnath Thombre,



      chief executive of Match Group Americas. “People have had enough time to reflect on what really matters to me, what makes me happy,” Mr. Thombre said. “They’re also being a little more clear on who they want to be.”  Get weekly insights into the ways companies optimize data, technology and design to drive success with their customers and employees.   The experts can narrow down the candidate pool, bringing forward people who might be more compatible, said Rachel DeAlto, chief dating expert at Match.  “It is really just going in and highlighting people and helping them to not feel as overwhelmed or frustrated,” she said. Match lets users set up profiles, look at other profiles and chat with the system’s “top picks” for them at no cost, but it charges subscription fees before members can communicate with the full pool of users. Further optional add-ons include sending unlimited “likes” to other users and the ability to boost one’s profile in other members’ search results. Dating services are also competing to enhance the experiences they provide. Match added free video calls in April 2020 as social-distancing made in-person dating harder. Tinder and Hinge, both of which are also owned by Match Group, have added new features as well, such as the new Explore section on Tinder that matches people by their interests. Many dating apps have seen an increase in users during the pandemic. Match Group reported 16.3 million paying subscribers in the third quarter, up from 14 million a year earlier. Company revenue totaled $802 million in the last quarter, an increase from $640 million the year prior. 

 Algorithms can solve many issues, but can’t always decipher context clues between people’s preferences in a dating app, said









      
      Brendan Gahan,



      partner and chief social officer at Mekanism Inc., an ad agency. “We’re not going to solely rely on algorithms—we want a human touch to help bring that human element and encourage that intimacy even further,” he said. Traditional matchmaking services are costly, starting in the thousands of dollars for just a few months. But these services are worth it to customers who don’t have the time to sort through candidates on apps, said









      
      Tammy Shaklee,



      founder and matchmaker of He’s For Me LLC, which operates H4M Matching, an LGBTQ matchmaking service. Matchmakers will contact people only if they think they have identified a potential lifelong partner—not just another date, Ms. Shaklee said. The new Match feature helps humanize online dating, and mirrors things many single people already do, like asking others for advice on whom to date, said









      
      Nick Notas,



      a dating coach for men at Eros Consulting Inc. “The frustration, the loneliness, everything that goes into the online dating experience—it sometimes clouds your judgment, and it is hard to take a step back and look objectively at things,” Mr. Notas said.

        AAPL,
        +2.80%,
       Microsoft 
        MSFT,

        +0.38%
       and Meta Platforms (Facebook) 
        FB,
        -0.02%.
       That’s because it’s rare for stocks at the top of the market-cap ranking to keep their status a decade later. Not only do they usually fall out of the top 10, they also underperform the market on average over the decade. That’s according to an analysis conducted by Research Affiliates, the investment firm headed by Robert Arnott. To show the precarious position of the market’s “top dogs,” he calculated what happened over the decade of the 1980s to the 10 largest publicly traded companies at the beginning of that 10-year period. Eight of the 10 were not on 1990’s top-10 list, and all 10 on 1980’s list underperformed the world stock market over the subsequent decade. Arnott found that the 1980s were not unique. He reached a similar result for the top stocks of the 1990s, 2000s, and 2010s. On average, a stock on any of these lists underperformed the market over the subsequent decade. In addition, there was between a 70% and 80% chance that any given stock would not be on the comparable list one decade hence. Arnott illustrated these top companies’ underperformance in another way as well: He constructed a hypothetical portfolio that each year owned the world’s 10-largest companies. The performance of this portfolio is plotted in the chart below. Over the 40 years from the end of 1980 through the end of 2020, this portfolio lagged a buy-and-hold by 1.8 annualized percentage points. Numerous investment lessons can be drawn from Arnott’s fascinating results. One is that cap-weighting is not the optimal weighting scheme for your portfolio. Equal-weighting is one obvious alternative, and it has beaten cap-weighting: since 1971, according to data from S&P Dow Jones Indices, the equal-weighted version of the S&P 500 
        SPX,
        +0.95%
       has outperformed the cap-weighted version by 1.5 annualized percentage points. Arnott believes there are even better ways of weighting stocks in an index beyond equal weighting. His firm maintains a number of so-called fundamental indices that base a stock’s weight on fundamental characteristics such as sales, cash flow, dividends and book equity value. 
        “Just six stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla and Meta Platforms — account for 26% of the S&P 500’s total market cap”
       But there’s another investment implication of Arnott’s data that I want to focus on: His results highlight the difficulties determining the valuation of a lopsided market.  Consider the S&P 500 currently, in which just six stocks — Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla 
        TSLA,
        +1.32%
       and Meta Platforms — account for 26% of the index’s total market cap. Imagine a situation in which those six are overvalued while the other 494 stocks, on balance, are more fairly valued. In that case, the valuation ratios for the S&P 500 as a whole could paint a skewed picture. This situation isn’t just hypothetical. The largest six stocks currently have an average price/earnings ratio of 62.0, according to FactSet, more than double the average across all stocks in the S&P 500 of 29.1 and almost triple its median P/E ratio of 21.4. It’s possible, therefore, that the stock market isn’t as overvalued as we would otherwise think by focusing on valuation ratios for the S&P 500 as a whole.

The main house, which has four bedrooms and six bathrooms, is relatively modest for a celebrity couple of such stature, Ms. Maize said. It is the backyard Walk of Fame that sets the property apart, Ms. Maize said. “They entertained a lot, and I was told that Kirk would have people autograph cement pavers at dinner parties,” she said. “There are 22 stones—some were from their previous property.” When she toured the property, she spent over an hour stepping through the stars, photographing and writing down the autographed names.

Kirk Douglas, who was one of the last surviving stars of Hollywood’s so-called Golden Age, was at the height of his career when in 1951 he divorced his first wife, Diana Dill, the mother of three of his four sons, and married Anne Buydens in 1954. Over the years, he starred in more than 90 films, receiving an Academy Honorary Award for Lifetime Achievement. For his philanthropic work, he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. A film producer, Anne received a Jefferson Award for Public Service in 2003.   Because of the limited inventory in Beverly Hills, the celebrity cachet and the unusual autographed pavers, Ms. Maize said she expects the property to sell quickly. “I priced it at land value,” she said. “And nothing in Beverly Hills that’s great sells for less than $9 million. We are accepting offers starting on Monday, and I expect to get 15 or more and for it to sell for substantially over the asking price.” The Douglas children did not reply to an email requesting comment. The listing was first reported by The Hollywood Reporter. Read Next Story COPYRIGHT © 2021 MANSION GLOBAL.

Known as the Old Palace, the 5,985-square-foot residence sits on close to 6.5 acres in the village of Wrotham, near Sevenoaks in Kent. It features all of the charm of a period home, but has been updated with modern amenities, according to the listing with Savills, which brought the property to the market last month.  “It has the delight of an old period build with an unbelievable amount of history,” said Savills agent Oliver Hodges. “But it’s been stitched together really well with an indoor pool and spa.” More: Offers for London Homes Hit 10-Year High in November The oldest part of the structure, which dates to 1340, was once a kitchen wing of the “long since demolished Archbishop’s Palace,” the listing said. The property has a Grade II* listing because of its impressive past, a designation given to structures of more than special interest, according to the preservation group Historic England. The Archbishops of Canterbury once used the palace as a stopover as they traveled to and from London, according to listing records cited by Savills. Most of the original structure was destroyed, and the materials were used to build the Maidstone Palace, also in Kent.  That accessibility to London remains a desirable attribute of the property, Mr. Hodges explained. Guests and residents can travel easily between London and the home, which is about 30 miles each way.  At the same time, “there’s a pub close by, so you definitely get that in-the-middle-of-a-village vibe,” the agent added.  From Penta: Electric Air Taxis Are About to Take Off The residence has seven bedrooms, six bathrooms and four reception rooms, the listing said. Design elements include high ceilings, exposed wooden beams, stone mullion windows, old and modern oak internal doors, a custom kitchen by New York City-based Smallbone and bathroom suites by Villeroy & Boch, a German manufacturer. A gated driveway leads to the home, which is surrounded by manicured lawns and gardens. There’s also a two-bedroom cottage and a six-bay garage with storage space above.  The property last traded in December 2014 for £3.25 million, according to records with the U.K. Land Registry. The owner was not available for comment. Read Next Story COPYRIGHT © 2021 MANSION GLOBAL.

Elon Musk
 is frequently lauded for simultaneously leading two companies, Tesla and Space X. Another executive who pulled off the same feat got less attention. He’s 
Stephan Winkelmann,
 who, for a year, helmed both Bugatti and Lamborghini—and still has the second role.  Winkelmann was already president of Bugatti in December 2020 when he signed on—again—as the top executive at Lamborghini. He also held that role from 2005 to 2016.  On Dec. 2, Winkelmann was in Greenwich, Conn., for the launch of Lamborghini Greenwich, a new multi-story facility operated by RDS Automotive Group, which also has dealerships for the brand in Philadelphia and Newport Beach, Calif., and also sells Maserati, Porsche, and 
McLaren
 cars.  “This is our 38th dealership in the U.S.,” Winkelmann tells Penta in the dealership’s conference room. “It’s a new location and new construction. Greenwich is a huge market for us, because it’s a prime place where wealthy individuals live.”  With an average household income of US$209,877, there’s a reason the Lamborghini Urus SUV, which has a starting price of US$218,009, is popular in Greenwich. In an indication of where car buying is going in wealthy communities like Greenwich, the town has the largest number of electric vehicle (
EV
) registrations in the state, followed by Stamford and then Westport (home base for the EV Club of Connecticut).  Lamborghini is moving quickly toward electrification. “We follow the dreams of our customers,” Winkelmann says. Currently Lamborghini offers as its main models the Huracan, Aventador, and Urus, as well as some limited-edition vehicles such as a Countach for the 21st century, called the LPI 800-4. The limited-to-63 
Sián,
 unveiled in 2019, is a mild hybrid that uses a supercapacitor for added oomph during rapid acceleration. There are also 19 Sián roadsters.  “The whole range will be plug-in hybrid by late 2024,” Winkelmann says. “Our fourth model will be our first electric car.” No dates or specifications are available for the battery EV yet, and Winkelmann didn’t offer an all-electric range for the hybrids. “We don’t have to decide today,” he says. The EV will reportedly be a four-seat model, and it could use a wide variety of technology developed for Group members Porsche, Audi, or VW itself. This is an enormous change for Lamborghini, which like Ferrari is famous for its V12 internal-combustion engines—going back to the company’s founding in 1963 by Ferruccio Lamborghini. The founder sold the company in 1974, and since then it’s been owned by various business conglomerates, and then Chrysler, followed in 1998 by Volkswagen (where it’s under Audi’s jurisdiction). The purchase price back then was around US$110 million. It’s since gained quite a bit of value.  Winkelmann is unsure how long internal-combustion cars will still be on the road, but Lamborghini is definitely phasing them out. The overall timetable for the auto fleet’s transition to batteries remains unclear. “There are hundreds of millions of internal-combustion cars now that will still be on the road in 2030,” he says. “What happens to them depends on legislation, and perhaps the development of cleaner synthetic fuels.” Lamborghini is aiming to reduce its carbon emissions 50 percent by 2025.  Lamborghini has enhanced its brand by opening lounges, so far in New York and Tokyo. Winkelmann said other locations soon could be London, Los Angeles, or Miami—which is fast becoming an auto center. But he said Lamborghini also has another venture—in Dubai. “We are building 40 six-bedroom villas, to be completed by 2026. They are homes, not skyscrapers or towers.”  The Dubai Hills Vista development with Emaar Properties, announced in November, is already sold out. It’s part of Emaar’s Dubai Hill’s Estate, 20 minutes from Dubai International Airport and the city’s downtown. A photo shows a two-story modern home with lots of glass, a pool, and a Lamborghini in the driveway. But there are four different types, each with Lamborghini-inspired furniture and interior design.  
Federico Foschini,
 chief marketing and sales officer of Automobili Lamborghini, said in a statement, “Forty discerning real-estate investors have chosen a Dubai Hills Vista villa, privileged with sophisticated interiors inspired by the Automobili Lamborghini brand that bring its essence to everyday life.” Despite the market challenges, Winkelmann thinks that 2021 will be a record sales year for the company, surpassing 2019. “We have had to increase production twice,” he says. “We are living in a crazy time.” The U.S. remains Lamborghini’s biggest market, and the Urus SUV is more than 50 percent of sales.  Elon Musk is frequently lauded for simultaneously leading two companies, Tesla and Space X.

And yet there is real elegance there. In Osaka, one finds the luxuries of a fully modern Japan intimately shaped by its regal past.  Among Japanese today, Osakans have a reputation for being direct, down to earth, and generally inviting. In Osaka, it is not uncommon for a traveler asking for directions from a passerby to be invited out for a drink or a meal of okonomiyaki, a grilled cabbage pancake and Osaka street-food speciality. Despite their fast-paced life and imposing sprawl, Osakans are warm.  Their friendliness perhaps stems from a long history interacting with outsiders as one of Japan’s largest trading centers. A sea port cut up by rivers and canals, this “city of water” has been an important axis of Pacific Ocean commerce from at least the 16th century. Specializing in foodstuffs, Osaka has long been known as the “kitchen of the nation.” Economic historians pinpoint the world’s first futures-trading to the city’s Dojima Rice Exchange, opened in 1697. Today, Osaka’s port remains one of Japan’s five largest and its culinary scene remains storied.  STAY For classic luxury and prime location, there’s the Ritz-Carlton Osaka in the bright and hurried Umeda district. Styled after an 18th-century English manor, with fine wood, sparkling chandeliers, and an ornate fireplace lobby straight out of Knightsbridge, this large hotel sits in the center of Osaka’s beating heart just a stone’s throw from Osaka Station, the city’s main train terminus; this is the go-to nexus for exploring Osaka’s many worthwhile satellite cities such as Kobe, Nara, and Kyoto.  For the Japanese touch, dine on excellent sashimi and top-shelf sake at the Michelin-starred Hanagatami Restaurant. Don’t skip a green tea on the 34th-floor Club Lounge, which offers unparalleled cityscape views.  For lodgings in a quieter quarter, check out the St. Regis on Midosuji Boulevard, Osaka’s main north-south thoroughfare, lined with ginkgo trees. Boasting a bevy of luxury outlets–Armani, Louis Vuitton, Chanel–the storied street is known as the Champs-Elysee of Osaka. This 160-room 
St. Regis
 features a world-class spa and uber-attentive “Butler Service.” Outside its high-ceilinged, 12th-floor lobby rests a charming garden terrace and rock garden, or karesansui, overlooking the trendy Minami district.  To escape the urban bustle all together, hop on a 30-minute shinkansen fast train to Kyoto and spend a night lounging in your own personal onsen at the Suiran Hotel (buy a rail pass here.) Located along the tranquil, jade-green Hozu River beside the 
Kameyama
 forest, this smallish retreat in the refined 
Arashiyama
 neighborhood tastefully fuses traditional Kyoto aesthetics with modern elegance and amenities. Guests enjoy a complimentary drink every evening in their riverside restaurant, Kyo-Suiran, a former summer residence built during the 19th-century Meiji Restoration.  EXPERIENCE  In Osaka, one of the first places visitors go is Dotonbori, and for good reason. A long, frenzied stretch of casual dining, shopping, and entertainment running alongside a picturesque canal, Dotonbori is best visited at night to fully appreciate the light show of neon winking storefronts. Many feature giant animatronic mascots, such as the iconic orange spider crab enticing passersby above the 
Koni Daraku
 restaurant. Pro tip: duck into one of Dotonbori’s many narrow side streets to find a less touristy eatery to try.  The next morning, take a leisurely stroll around the stupendous 
Osaka Castle,
 one of Japan’s most iconic archeological treasures. Constructed in the 16th century, it sits behind tall ancient walls on a lovely island surrounded by a wide moat. Numerous gardens, a small museum and fashionable gift shops provide plenty for the leisurely visitor to explore.  Osaka is a popular jumping off point for nearby day trips. The nearest worthwhile destination is the temple town of Kyoto, one of Japan’s most charming municipalities, boasting 17 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and only half an hour away by shinkansen. Its 1,600 Buddhist temples are a main draw, as are its many elegant teahouses. Recommended is the brightly gilded Kinkaju-ji, the subject of 
Yukio Mishima’s
 poignant novel, The Temple of the Golden Pavilion, based on a real-life arson incident at the site in 1950.    EAT & DRINK Osaka is one of the world’s greatest food cities, though few outside of Japan know it. Fine dining in particular abounds and the metropolis is littered with Michelin stars. One eatery with three of those famed stars is Fujiya 1935. The small, sparse restaurant boasts a seasonal, ever-changing menu of inventive, Euro-Japanese dishes that are colorful as they are scrumptious. Think ginkgo nut crepe with pacific saury and finger lime, or chestnut pudding with rum-flavored coffee jelly.  Another three-star must-try is Koryu, the seafood-heavy brainchild of chef 
Shintaro Matsuo,
 who was born and educated in the culinary arts in Osaka. With room for only a handful of diners, there is no menu; Matsuo-san uses whichever ingredients are freshest that day. Expect lots of raw fish and a friendly hello, from the genial chef.  After dinner, make your way to Bar K, a tiny, dimly-lit basement speakeasy in the clubby Kita Shinchi District. With an impressive collection of Scottish single malt whiskey, it is one of Osaka’s finest drinking holes–they also make what might be the best mojito you’ll ever try. For gin-lovers, there is Bar Juniper, a sleek, classic kind of place with handsomely-dressed bartenders and a rich 
bevvy
 of gin varieties, some up to a century old.  The writer was hosted by St. Regis, the Ritz Carlton, and the Suiran.  There is a certain romanticism associated with Japan’s third-largest city, Osaka, a name that conjures up enticing wonders of faraway Japan.

A range of big names—from aviation stalwarts to well-funded start-ups—are working to make electric air taxis a reality. While the sector is in its infancy and several key factors remain uncertain, many insiders believe we’ll see what in industry parlance are called electric vertical-takeoff-and-landing (eVTOL) aircraft take to the skies in the near future. “New technologies have often been met with skepticism,” says Balkiz Sarihan, Airbus’ head of UAM (urban air mobility) strategy execution and partnerships. “Remember the smartphone, which was depicted as a luxury item and now has become an integrated part of our lives. Today, nobody can imagine life without one.”  Airbus has emerged as a major player in the sector, having started eVTOL activities in 2014 that led to the development of two demonstrators: Vahana, a single-seat, tilt-wing, self-piloted model; and CityAirbus, a four-seat, remotely piloted multicopter that features four ducted, high-lift propulsion units. Flight testing with those two vehicles has now finished; in total they performed 242 flight and ground tests and flew over 600 miles.  Skeptics point to a lack of a proven business model, while questioning whether the public will embrace the sort of futuristic vessels that look like they belong to a science-fiction villain. Prototypes and renderings of eVTOLs resemble a helicopter crossed with a small airplane, with curved, aerodynamic features.  Headwinds & Tailwinds  A key question without a common answer is who will fly these planes. A handful of companies are focusing on single-passenger aircraft, meaning the customer will be responsible for certain functions, and others feature multiple seats with room for a pilot, though industry experts don’t think it will be financially feasible for companies to find, train, and pay the number of pilots required for widespread operations. Naysayers also wonder about the inevitable regulatory hurdles—the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has never approved electric aircraft, pilotless or otherwise—plus noise issues and other practical matters such as whether eVTOLs will need landing pads. Advocates, however, say air taxis would provide relief from the traffic- choked streets that slow down business and make the world’s megacities frustrating to navigate.  California-based Archer Aviation has signed a $1 billion aircraft purchase and collaboration agreement with United Airlines Holdings, making Archer the first eVTOL company to gain a contract from a major airline.  Archer claims it will be able to transport passengers from San Francisco to San Jose in California in 20 minutes rather than 90, or from Manhattan to John F. Kennedy International Airport in just 10 minutes.  But most eVTOLs are expected to be priced in the hundreds of thousands and up, making them out of reach to most individual buyers. Most companies will likely adopt a ride-hailing and -sharing model similar to Uber’s, which would enable the aircraft costs to be shared among many riders.  Archer’s battery-powered aircraft are designed to travel at speeds of up to 150 miles per hour for up to 60 miles at a time. The company has announced the development of UAM networks in its launch cities of Los Angeles and Miami. At launch, Archer is estimating the price to be $3.30 per passenger mile, then decreasing over time as more aircraft become available.  Says 
Brett Adcock,
 Archer’s co-founder, “This new mode of transportation will revolutionize the way we interact with and move around urban environments.”  This article appears in the December 2021 issue of Penta magazine.
